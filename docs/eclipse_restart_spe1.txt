This files contains additional information about the structure of restart files generated in ECLIPSE. 

This applies to the case spe1 in the opm-data repository. 

INTEHEAD:
0: Value based on computer time in which the file was written
67: Timestep
68: Report step
219: Report step-1


DOUBHEAD:
0: days
157: Reservoir mean pressure
158: A double related to RS, but does not impact solution
161: A whole number, value = 735979 + days

IWEL:
Changes during eclipse simulation. Reset to start values at restart stage does not impact solution. 

These KS are unchanged during simulation:
LOGIHEAD
IGRP
SGRP
SWEL
ZWLS
ICON
SCON


KW that does not need to be present:
XGRP
ZGRP
XWEL
IWLS
XCON
DLYTIM
HIDDEN
REGDIMS
