This files contains additional information about the structure of restart files generated in ECLIPSE. 

This applies to the case spe1 in the opm-data repository. 

INTEHEAD:
0: Value based on computer time in which the file was written
67: Timestep
68: Report step
219: Report step-1
Values not described her or in ecl_kw_magic, are constant during simulation. 

LOGIHEAD
86: does not impact solution
Values not described her or in ecl_kw_magic, are constant during simulation. 

DOUBHEAD:
0: days
157: Reservoir mean pressure
158: A double related to RS, but does not impact solution
161: A whole number, value = 735979 + days
(735979 / 365.25 = 2015.00007. Number of days since year 0)
Values not described her or in ecl_kw_magic, are constant during simulation. 

IWEL:
Changes during eclipse simulation. Reset to start values at restart stage does not impact solution. Related to the values:
index: 7
index: 8
index: 23
index: 141
index: 154
index: 178
All values except 7, 8, 23 , 141 154 and 178 are constant during simulation. 
Known IWELS in addition to ecl_kw_agic:
0: PROD, X
1: PROD, Y
2: COMPDAT, 'PROD', item 4
3: COMPDAT, 'PROD', item 5
4: Number of completion connections
7, 8, 15: Uncertain
157: COMPDAT, 'INJ', item 4
158: COMPDAT, 'INJ', item 5
159: Number of completion connections
168: Uncertain

SWEL:
Mostly SWEL will contain the values:
0
1
+/-100000002004087734272, which are either missing entries in the .DATA file or settings. 
Otherwise:
Production:
0: WCONPROD, item 4, noentry = 100000002004087734272
2: WCONPROD, item 6, noentry = 100000002004087734272
6: WCONPROD, item 9
9: WELSPECS, 'PROD', item 5
54: same as index: 2
55: same as index: 6
122: WCONINJ, item 6:????????????
124: WCONINJ, item 5
128: WCONINJ, item 7
131: WELSPECS, 'INJ', item 5
176: same as index: 124
177: same as index: 128
During simulation spe1, SWEL is constant. 

ICON:
1: I coordinate
2: J coordinate
3: K coordinate
4: Number of cells
During simulation spe1, ICON is constant. 


These KS are unchanged during simulation (spe1):
LOGIHEAD
IGRP
SGRP
SWEL
ZWLS
ICON
SCON


KW that does not need to be present (can be removed):
XGRP
ZGRP
XWEL
IWLS
XCON
DLYTIM
HIDDEN
REGDIMS
FIPFAMNA
REGRPT

note about STARTSOL:
ECLIPSE may cause if error or bugs anything unknwon or unecessary is added after STARTSOL
In spe1, there are some extra KWs after ENDSOL, and the TEMP and RV words, which should be removed.
